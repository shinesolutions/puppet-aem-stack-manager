overview: >
  This class writes the `application.properties` file for the AEM Stack
  Manager.  It is auto-generated and should not be modified by hand.
  Documentation for each of the properties can be found in the example
  `application.properties` from which it is generated. (see below)

  _Note:_ This is an internal class that shouldn't be used directly. It is
  included by the `aem_stack_manager` class. You can change values for it's
  parameters using Hiera.
